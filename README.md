# Basics

## Categories of Cocktails

In general cocktails tend to fall into one of two categories:

- Spirit Forward (no citrus juice) - ex a Martini
- Citrus (contains juice from lime, lemon, orange, grapefruit etc) - ex a Margarita

## Stirring Vs Shaking

The purpose of ice in a drink is twofold: 

1. To chill the drink, which alters the mouth feel and flavor - ex a warm cocktail will taste sweeter than a cold one
2. To dillute the drink, which makes the drink more palatable

Both shaking an stirring will accomplish both of these - but these techniques . Drinks with acid (ex lime or lemon juice) in them require more dillution and benefit from agitation - which helps the flavors "blend" better - shaking is perfect for this. On the other hand drinks that are spirit forward are all about savoring the unique flavors of the chosen spirit(s); shaking them would introduce too much dillution and cause the cocktail to appear muddled & cloudy, we should stir them .instead 

Hence a great rule of thumb is if your drink has citrus juice in it (lemon, lime, orange, grapefruit etc) you should shake the drink - otherwise stir. When shaking 8-10 shakes is plenty and with stirring you should do so gently so as not to cloud the cocktail and look for around 25-30% dillution (incease in volume). 

## Rules For Spirit Forward Cocktails

- Use top-shelf spirits since you can really taste everything the spirit offers here
- Stir them

## Rules For Citrus Cocktails

- Shake them
- Always use fresh squeezed juice - never frozen or store bought! Fresh juice is really the key to a great cocktail 
- Use a quality spirit, but it doesn't have to be top-shelf since the citrus and other flavors will wipe away some of the subtler flavors of the spirit
